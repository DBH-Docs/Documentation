# Node 3 is full

Multiple users reported the troubleshooting issue with the Node 3. An error is similar to the other full disk issue:

A temporary solution is to shift to the other hosting node. In order to do that:

* Head to the server [panel](//panel.danbot.host/)
* Select all files in the "File manager"
* Archive them and download the archive
* Create a new server and upload previously downloaded archive
* Unarchive it and delete the file left
