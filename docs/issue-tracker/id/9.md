# Freemium nodes' full disk

This issue was encountered related to Node 5 and Node 6. [Status page](//status.danbot.host/) returns wrong values for the disk.

A temporary solution is to shift to the other hosting node. In order to do that:

* Head to the server [panel](//panel.danbot.host/)
* Select all files in the "File manager"
* Archive them and download the archive
* Create a new server and upload previously downloaded archive
* Unarchive it and delete the file left
