# Proxying

Bot can not fully proxy the domain. Certificate bot keeps hanging up and that's why bot does not ping the executor for finishing of proxying. A possible solution is to use custom proxy services.

Update on 02.05.2022: An issue has been resolved after 42 days of it being broken. It is now recommended to use `192.95.42.75` canadian proxy IP!
