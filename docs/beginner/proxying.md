# Proxying

Proxying might sound a hard job to do but actually it's not! In this page I used cloudflare to proxy my domain!

## Set DNS record

In order to proxy your domain to one of your servers you have to set a DNS record!

There after clicking "Add record" you have to fill all fields as in the image:

**Note**: if you're using cloudflare consider turning off "Proxy Status".

After everything is done click "Save" and head to discord!

## Proxy using a command

As always you should use given in [Getting Started](/getting-started) channels. Do `DBH!server proxy <domain> <server id>` in order to proxy your domain to your server. Make sure "domain" field doesn't have neither "http://" nor "https://" in it!

After it is done you have to wait up to 1-2 minutes to see the result. Bot will ping you if it is proxied!

**Note**: if you faced a problem and bot didn't give you a success result please consider contacting moderation in order to fix your issue. Also make sure everything is fine in your proxy fields!
