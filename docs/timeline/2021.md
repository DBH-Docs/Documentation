# 2021 Timeline Details

A lot happened in 2021, it was rather an exciting year gotta admit. Full of events positive and negative obviously not everything can be positive.

All throughout 2021 DBH grew, and grew and grew. We reach 6k total members and 10k clients hosting. A big milestone for DBH.
Addition to DBH's growth this was at the same time as Epic Games did their free nitro giveaways. So everyone joined and boosted, 
back in early/ mid 2021 boosters got premium server perks. Which caused a lot of trouble and donator nodes always down.
As well as the donator nodes, free nodes were also in trouble they were always going down and were just a complete mess.

- **15/02/2021**, was when Lucifier became a Helper same with loads of others. Such as Curry, Armic and a few others which names aren't as recognisable. 
    - A positive event early stages of 2021 was when Lucifier got admin, he was one of the best admins DBH ever had. Helped in almost every situation. 
      Lucifier wasn't the only good staff we gained in 2021, we gained a few. Dotto especially (not saying other mods are useless <3). Dotto samed with Lucifier
      had an answer for every situation. Even if they didn't know they would both try there best.

- **13/06/2021**, Dotto and James became helpers.
- **29/06/2021**, Freddie became a DBH developer. Freddie had another promotion in early 2022 which he got promoted to Panel Admin.
- **30/06/2021**, Node 7 switched to a OVH dedi. 
- **12/07/2021**, More of a fun one that anything, but people started to block Dotto due to Italy won the Football!

- **17/07/2021**, Dotto and James got promoted to Moderator. This was one of the fastest promotions in DBH History, at 1 month of being staff (Might need to be fact checked).
  - Darkerink was also promoted on the same day as Dotto and James.
- **02/07/2021**, This was when the first DBH VPS was made.

Moving towards October/Novemember this was when things between Solo and Dan weren't so good. Causing even more problems which didn't help in anyones favour.
- **14/10/2021**, DBH Raided.
    - Causing everyone to be banned from the server, but it wasn't just the discord server that got raided. It was also the panel,.
      Information that got leaked includes:
          - Usernames 
          - Emails
          - Potentially bot files.
      The raid got blamed onto solo, some people tried to say otherwise due to their was no proof of solo actually doing it.
      However, most people listened to Dan so solo got the blame for the raid. Causing himself to get banned from DBH and all it's contents.

- **11/12/2021** was when people in DBH started to celebrate Christmas 2021.
- **21/12/2021** Sarah got demoted from Admin To Moderator. AVIXITY got promoted to Moderator.
