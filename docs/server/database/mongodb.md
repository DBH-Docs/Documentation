# Creating the server
To create a server, we suppose that you've already [created and linked an account into the panel](https://help.dbh.wtf/getting-started).

In that case, go to DBH server and run this command:

For a free server: `DBH!server create mongodb [optional server name]`

For a donator server: `DBH!server create-donator mongodb [optional name]`
