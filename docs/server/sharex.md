# What is ShareX
ShareX can be used to capture full screen or partial screenshots (which can be exported into various image formats), such as rectangle capture and window capture. It can also record animated GIF files and video using FFmpeg.

In this document we will show you how to create one, configure it and upload your first screenshot. 

# Creating the Serverserver
To create a server, we suppose that you've already [created and linked an account into the panel.](https://help.dbh.wtf/getting-started)

In that case, go to DBH server and run this command:

For a free server: `DBH!server create sharex [optional server name]`

For a donator server: `DBH!server create-donator sharex [optional server name]`

# Configuration
Coming soon...
